    "For this part of the assignment, you're going to implement the Sandpile model by writing an agent object by yourself. The model is a cellular automaton. Each cell on a finite board has an associated value that corresponds to the volume of the sands. At each unit time, one unit sand will be placed onto one random cell. If the volume exceeds a specific threshold, that cell will collapse and transfer the sand into the adjacent cells to increase their volumes until the system gets stable. In some cases, the sandpile will generate a very beautiful fractal structure.\n",

    "## Part 2.2: Pollution spread across the water supply network (8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question** In many applications, we want to simulate the dynamics based on the graph topology, i.e. how do neighbors in the network communicate information with each other. For example, if there exists the pollutant in one water stations, and then it begins to spread through the pipes, how quickly will all the water stations get polluted? And which groups of water stations will be polluted early?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the simplified assumptions for the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three water stations have pollutant first. They are node 15, node 22, and node 27 (0-based node index). Therefore, these 3 nodes are considered as the 'seed' of pollution in the graph.\n",
    "An 'pollution value' array can be created to label the nodes. For example, the 3 seed nodes are labeled as '1' at the beginning ('1' means they are polluted for sure 100%), and all other nodes are labeled as '0' at the beginning ('0' means they are totally clean).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You write a for loop to do the simulation, where each step in the loop represent a specific time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At each time point, the pollution value for every node is updated, based on the pollution values of their neighbors in the graph, because if many neighbors are polluted, it is very likely the water station will be polluted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each node will spread pollution to its neighbors with a probability that is inversely proportional to its degree. The more neighbors, the less pollutant that the node will spread to one of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For example, if node A has two neighbors: B and C. Node B has a degree of 3 and node C has a degree of 5. Then the pollution value of node A for the next iteration should be updated as: new_value(A) = value(B)/3 +value(C)/5\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In each iteration of your simulation, you scan all nodes and update the values of pollution labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** you may need to use copy() to avoid the confusion between previous values and newly updated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
